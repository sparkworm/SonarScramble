Welcome to Memory Maze!

In this game, the player is given a "glance" at a maze they must navigate 
through.  This glace only lasts about a second, so they must memorize the path 
through the maze as well as any hazards that they might encounter.  They might
be given additional glances, but these would cost them score.

The player is piloting a submarine, with the "glances" consisting of radar blips
each of which costs energy to produce.  The player is rewarded for using fewer, 
but they are punished for running into anything, so they must balance to 
achieve a good score.
